# Take Home Problem

Tech companies often send prospective employees home with a small project to demonstrate their aptitude.  Please read the below instructions, implement each one, and push your finished project to github.  Take the time to ensure each piece works the way you expect it to, and style it to be readable.  

## Garden Tracker
This year, your garden is doing great.  To see how you did, you'd like to track how many of each vegetable you have harvested for the year.

* Fork and clone this project.
* Populate the database with at least 3 vegetable names, with their counters starting at 0.
* On the ShowVeggies component, map through the names and counter for each database item.
* Include a button to increase the counter number on click.
* Style the information, including the button, using Bootstrap.
* Push your solution to your personal GitHub account.

* BONUS: Create a new component inside ShowVeggies that allows you to add new vegetable names to the database, with a starting counter of 0.
