## Take Home Problem

Tech companies often send prospective employees home with a small project to demonstrate their aptitude.  Please read the below instructions, implement each one, and push your finished project to github.  Take the time to ensure each piece works the way you expect it to, and style it to be readable.  

* Populate the database with at least 2 names, and counters starting at 0.
* On ShowThings, map through the names and counter for each database item.
* Include a button to increase the counter number on click.
* Style the information, including the button, using Bootstrap.

* BONUS: Create a new component inside ShowThings that allows you to add new names to the database, with a starting counter of 0.
