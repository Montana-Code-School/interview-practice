# Take Home Problem

Tech companies often send prospective employees home with a small project to demonstrate their aptitude.  Please read the below instructions, implement each one, and push your finished project to github.  Take the time to ensure each piece works the way you expect it to, and style it to be readable.  

## Garden Tracker
This year, your garden is doing great.  To see how you did, you'd like to track how many of each of these vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans) you have harvested for the year.

* Fork and clone this project.
* Ensure all vegetables in the database, and their harvest count, are displayed.
* Include a button to increase the harvest count.
* Style the information, including the button, using Bootstrap.
* Push your solution to your personal GitHub account.

* BONUS: Find a way to add new vegetable names to the database from the front end, with a starting counter of 0.
